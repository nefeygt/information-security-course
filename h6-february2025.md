## x) Read or watch and summarize: € Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.
1. One-Way Functions:
   - A function is one-way if it’s easy to compute in one direction but computationally infeasible to reverse.
   - Example: Multiplying two large primes is easy; factoring the product back into primes is hard.
   - Used in cryptographic systems like RSA for key generation.
2. One-Way Hash Functions:
   - A hash function takes an input (of any size) and produces a fixed-size output (hash).
   - Properties:
      - Preimage resistance: Given a hash, it’s hard to find the original input.
      - Second preimage resistance: Given an input, it’s hard to find another input with the same hash.
      - Collision resistance: It’s hard to find two different inputs with the same hash.
   - Examples: MD5 (broken), SHA-1 (deprecated), SHA-256 (secure).
   - Applications: Digital signatures, password storage, data integrity checks.
