# h3 Hello Lab

## x) Read/watch/listen and summarize:
1. Install Debian on Virtualbox - Updated 2024:
   - I followed the guide step-by-step and succesffuly set my Debian up.
   - Everything is working as intended.
   - I also installed the drivers (guest additions) for better resolution.
2. Command Line Basics Revisited:
   - I revisited the basic Linux commands such as: pwd, ls, cd, less√º | (pipe), nano, mkdir, mv, cp, rmdir, rm, rm -r, ssh, exit, man, wget, history, sudo, dpkg, 
   - I learned these new: scp
   - I learned the important directories: /, /home/, /home/tero/, /etc/, /media/, /var/log/
   - I used the commands and practiced them.
   - I downloaded nethack and saw that it runs, then I deleted it.

## a) Can't fish:

   -Ping is basically packets called ICMP Echo request, in the screenshot there are several fields:
      -icmp_seq: sequence of the ping packets in that whole ping function
      -ttl: means time-to-live, total number of hops before dropping a packet
      -time: total time of the ping packet starting from sending and ending in recieving
   -I learned these words in my networking course last year.
3. ping 8.8.8.8 (connected to the internet):
   -![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a85287a1-1cf4-4ad6-aba8-fd87ace66722)

## d) Bandit oh-five:
-First I installed SSH.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9fd56bf-43c7-4e47-a840-9f33f029b877)
I learned that the password for level 1 is: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If

From the hidden file I found the password of the next level: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx

From another file I found the next level's password to be: MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx

From the next level's hiden file I found the password to the Level 5 to be: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ

The last password of this homework is: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
