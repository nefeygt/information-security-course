## x) Read/watch/listen and summarize:
1. Install Debian on Virtualbox - Updated 2024:
   - I followed the guide step-by-step and succesffuly set my Debian up.
   - Everything is working as intended.
   - I also installed the drivers (guest additions) for better resolution.
2. Command Line Basics Revisited:
   - I revisited the basic Linux commands such as: pwd, ls, cd, less√º | (pipe), nano, mkdir, mv, cp, rmdir, rm, rm -r, ssh, exit, man, wget, history, sudo, dpkg, 
   - I learned these new: scp
   - I learned the important directories: /, /home/, /home/tero/, /etc/, /media/, /var/log/
   - I used the commands and practiced them.
   - I downloaded nethack and saw that it runs, then I deleted it.

   -Ping is basically packets called ICMP Echo request, in the screenshot there are several fields:
      -icmp_seq: sequence of the ping packets in that whole ping function
      -ttl: means time-to-live, total number of hops before dropping a packet
      -time: total time of the ping packet starting from sending and ending in recieving
   -I learned these words in my networking course last year.
3. ping 8.8.8.8 (connected to the internet):
