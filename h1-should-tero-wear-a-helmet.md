# h1 Should Tero wear a helmet?

## x) Read / watch / listen and summarize:

### Threat Modeling:
1. 
   - Looks like it required a good effor to create this manifesto. It's like an open source general guideline to follow for threat modeling.
   - Short and effective explanation and solutions.
   - Informative and user-friendly web page.
2. 
   - Brief introduction to Threat Modeling
   - Answering the questions like four questions, why threat modeling etc. 
   - Explains technical words, explains how we are going to use the four questions in practice.
   - Overall entertaining and informative videos about threat modeling. I enjoyed watching it and now have a better understanding of the term "Threat Modeling".
3. 
   - A more detailed and explanatory documentation of Threat Modeling.
   - Explains the same concepts in a more detailed another perspective.
   - I liked the general structure and visuals of this page.

### Infosec scene:

I just finished listening and like the podcast. It was fast, I didn't get bored whiel listening. It's about the story of a teenager who is obsessed with hacking stuff. It reminded me of the recent hacking and data stealing stuff in Turkey.

## a) Security hygiene:

From general knowledge I might say:
- Applying BYOD principles in schools and offices.
- Being knowledgeable about information security field.
- Not connecting to public wifis.
- Not using every USB driver we see.

## b) Make-belief boogie-man:

Let's say that I have an imaginary company named UnU Games. In this company we are a group of people and everybody has their own job to do. Business requirements are being handled by the business team, tech stuff is being handled by the tech team. Now let's apply the four questions for threat modeling because we want our company to be safe.

1. What are we working on?
   - We are working on creating games from various genres. Due to this high number of game types we have a lot of customers and their valuable data.
   - We want secure databases so the business can keep flowing.
   - We are known for our high quality, entertaining games and secure servers because no incident happened about security or about the valuable information of our customers. So people trust us, and we should be able to maintain their trust in order to do business and earn money.
2. What can go wrong?
   - Since we are a huge company with a large customer base, hackers are targeting us.
   - They may arrange organized attacks against us to steal, to ask money from us. (Expected Value: 1000 * 0.1)
   - They may attack to our servers so we can't keep the process running and they'll be harming our company economy. (Expected Value: 100000 * 0.4, so this is higher priority)
3. What are we going to do about it?
   - We can add rate limits to our project so no one can send too many requests and this will help increase the security.
   - We can use META model to help increase the security.
4. Did we do a good enough job?
   - We can automatize this process becaue this is not a one time job. Security is a serious thing and should be continuously implemented.
   - We should alwways be checking and controlling our system if it's still efficiently working.

### Technical Words Learned:
Four questions (what are we working on, what can go wrong, what are we going to do about it, did we do a good job), Threat Modeling Manifesto, sketching, data flow diagrams, risk management, TOE (Target of Evaluation), system modeling, threat identification, STRIDE, TTP, COI, META.
