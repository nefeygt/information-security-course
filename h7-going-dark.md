## x) Read and summarize:
1. Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor:
  - Despite NSA/FBI attempts, Tor’s core anonymity remains unbroken. Attacks rely on browser exploits/user misconfiguration, not cryptographic flaws.
  - Used by activists, journalists, military, and privacy-conscious users. Criminals have better tools (botnets).
  - Open-source and audited. Initial Navy funding ≠ backdoor.
  - No U.S. prosecutions for relay operators. EFF runs its own relay.
  - Tor Browser Bundle and Tails OS simplify secure browsing.
  - Faster than ever, but more relays = better performance.
  - Anonymity requires proper use (no logging into Google/Facebook, avoiding traffic correlation).
2. Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser:
   - Introduction: Tor’s role in enabling anonymity for both privacy advocates and criminals.
   - History and Intended Use: Developed by U.S. Navy for secure communication; later open-sourced for public use to promote free speech and privacy.
   - How Tor Works:
      - Traffic routed through 3+ encrypted nodes (entry → middle → exit).
      - Each node decrypts only one layer (like an onion), preventing full path exposure.
   - Tracking Criminals:
      - Law enforcement uses flaws (e.g., malware, traffic analysis) to de-anonymize targets.
      - Case studies show Tor’s limitations against advanced adversaries.

## a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses).: <br>
I downloaded it from TOR's official website which was provided on Tero's hw instructions:

I did some surfing and it's interesting for my first time here

## b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment: <br>
It's not that hard to browse TOR because when you do some duduckgo'ing you get the answers easily.
-search engine for onion sites:
DuckDuckGo is the main and most famous search engine for .onion sites. It's safe and secure.

-marketplace:
When I searched for the word "marketplace" with duckduckgo I found this website:https://hiddenindex.org/
And when I got in I saw a list of the "dark" marketplaces:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f21b1ae0-5be9-4d02-b280-922495966ebc)
I found one of the websites interesting "stealing credit cards":
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0697fe6c-0fc9-466f-9388-a6c3c18f5201)
It got reeeeeally interesting because they're selling like 4k dollars for 80 dollars :D
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60161c9c-e0fe-40ab-a003-78e2d7a8ac9e)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/650a049b-525a-4707-bea0-d0606b995246)
It was really interesting
-forum:
basically the reddit of darknet is "dread":
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5af1065c-0e14-4725-8827-b245c94600dd)
I found this while surfing
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2872851-56ef-479c-b2bf-f53eee050061)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7237ae84-46c5-408e-b72c-2f55a1c7e820)
After waiting for about 3 mins I got into the forum
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e0cec5e-f133-49a8-b301-fc48ae2525d8)
There were some interesting topics
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8856429-6f76-47c8-9887-18d557f009a1)
-a site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world
the most famous one first comes to my mind is proton mail:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4935176f-c481-45d5-8ab0-23f719d3be5a)
As you can see on bottom left they have an actual address in switzerland

## c) Voluntary: Browse I2P network. Install necessary software.: <br>
I installed ana ran the I2p server:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3f5ab50-ed53-434d-b80a-555c187eaf5b)
Then I accessed it from the usual link http://127.0.0.1:7657/:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d6a860d-0f00-408b-beae-bdbaa6e23734)
It made me wait for a minute while doing the bandwidth test:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f958c99c-9d4a-43fc-85d9-32ce417415df)
I got these setting defaultly:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f18f0e71-1990-4d4f-b27f-bdb52ab58f0c)
I accessed the router console:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dd13bc6-f701-4452-a29d-0b81a21dac6d)
It was interesting to explore the interface:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/669272b6-0092-4bae-946c-880e2d46d363)

## e) Voluntary: Crypto hunter. Find Bitcoin address from a darknet site. Use the public ledger to find out if money has been transferred to that address.: <br>
I will use the btc address that I found in credit card selling website because that was really interesting for me:
I gave some fake info to reach the btc address of the guys
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17a53d54-61d9-451e-ad3f-c4574c3490ab)
And I reached the btc address: (bc1qjv4pqd3zw8gya0fgud2vl9wecd97ehwjlfkheq)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/004983ae-f08b-40dc-9d19-1b2ebf1c7d6f)
Now let's check it from a blockchain explorer:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c935943e-b30f-4065-bc17-a624772660f8)
we got a match! let's check inside
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2ca1e3e-d530-455f-b76f-a0672351590f)
It's an empty btc address with zero transactions, so probably it's just scam
I wanted to check another address from the website and I got results:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c39437b-1143-486d-972c-9d0466f4539a)
And the results were acutally very interesting because there are some big amounts of moneys going around (like 15k dollars):
