## x) Read and summarize:
a. Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor:
  1. Despite NSA/FBI attempts, Tor’s core anonymity remains unbroken. Attacks rely on browser exploits/user misconfiguration, not cryptographic flaws.
  2. Used by activists, journalists, military, and privacy-conscious users. Criminals have better tools (botnets).
  3. Open-source and audited. Initial Navy funding ≠ backdoor.
  4. No U.S. prosecutions for relay operators. EFF runs its own relay.
  5. Tor Browser Bundle and Tails OS simplify secure browsing.
  6. Faster than ever, but more relays = better performance.
  7. Anonymity requires proper use (no logging into Google/Facebook, avoiding traffic correlation).
b. Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser:
   - Introduction: Tor’s role in enabling anonymity for both privacy advocates and criminals.
   - History and Intended Use: Developed by U.S. Navy for secure communication; later open-sourced for public use to promote free speech and privacy.
   - How Tor Works:
      - Traffic routed through 3+ encrypted nodes (entry → middle → exit).
      - Each node decrypts only one layer (like an onion), preventing full path exposure.
   - Tracking Criminals:
      - Law enforcement uses flaws (e.g., malware, traffic analysis) to de-anonymize targets.
      - Case studies show Tor’s limitations against advanced adversaries.

## a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses).: <br>

## b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment: <br>
-search engine for onion sites
-marketplace
-forum
-a site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world

## c) Voluntary: Browse I2P network. Install necessary software.: <br>

## d) Voluntary or alternative task: No onion. You can do this task in place of a and b. Install a darknet browser other than TOR, such as I2P or Freenet. Search, screenshot and describe examples of contents there.: <br>
I created a zip file and by following the steps from the last question I cracked it's password and it's correct!

## e) Voluntary: Crypto hunter. Find Bitcoin address from a darknet site. Use the public ledger to find out if money has been transferred to that address.: <br>
